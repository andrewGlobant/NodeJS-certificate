# Prototypal Inheritance

Using any of the approaches described create a prototypal inheritance chain and then create an instance from that chain, and assign it to felix such that:

The prototype of felix should be an object with a meow method

The prototype of that object should be an object with a purr method

The prototype of that object should be an object with a hiss method

When ready, open a terminal, navigate to the labs-2 folder and run your implementation with
node app.js
This program will not run correctly, it will throw exceptions, until the implementation is complete.
