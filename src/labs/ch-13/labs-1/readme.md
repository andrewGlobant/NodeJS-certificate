# Read Directory and Write File

Complete the function named exercise so that all the files in the project folder, as stored in the project constant, are written to the out.txt file as stored in the out constant. Only the file names should be stored, not the full file paths, and file names should be comma separated.

For instance, given a project folder with the following files:

0p2ly0dluiw
2ftl32u5zu5
8t4iilscua6
90370mamnse
zfw8w7f8sm8

The out.txt should then contain: 0p2ly0dluiw,2ftl32u5zu5,8t4iilscua6,90370mamnse,zfw8w7f8sm8

If successfully implemented, the process will output: passed!.
